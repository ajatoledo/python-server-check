This directory contains files needed to use the provided bash script to loop through a pre-defined csv file of hostnames and arguments. 

## TODO:

Users should update host_list_example.csv to hostnames that should be checked along with the associated arguments.
*Note: the domains on the provided example are just generic (but real) hosts which are not affiliated with this in any way and should be removed when creating a list of hostnames.*
